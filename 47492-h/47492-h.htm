it might have been told by a soldier present during most of the fort&rsquo;s
active years. The soldier and his journal never existed, but the facts
contained in the journal are basically true. The information in this

<p>Fort Garland, July 29th, 1860. Arrived here yesterday
with my company, Company F of the U. S. 10th Infantry.
Our outfit just limped in from a 640 mile march from Camp
Floyd, Utah Territory. Took us most a month. Our commander&rsquo;s
name is Major (E.R.S.) Canby. It&rsquo;s good to bunk
down some place indoors for a change and to wash some of
the dust out of my throat and off my trail-weary feet. Too
tired to look around new post today.</p>
<p>Fort Garland, August 10th, 1860. Getting settled.
Guess my company will be here awhile. Major Canby and
Company A left a few days ago to quiet some outlaw Indians
(Navajos) somewhere southwest of here. Companies
F and H of the 10th remained.</p>
<p>Looked into the past of this fort. Named for Brevet
Brigadier General John Garland, commanding the Department
of New Mexico. It was built in 1858 by Captain Tom
Duncan and his Mounted Riflemen, with a company (Company
A) of the 3rd Infantry. Seems Fort Massachusetts,
north of here some six miles, was built in 1852 to protect
this area from the Indians. After a few years on this frontier
with bands of Ute Indians all around they decided the old
fort was too close under the mountains to be safe against
surprise attack, so the command was moved down here on
the open plain. Guess if the wind doesn&rsquo;t blow us all away,
the post will stick it out here until the last Indian is dead or
put off somewhere on the desert to eat sand and yucca.</p>
<p>September 12, 1860. Got a promotion today. We all
fell out for first call at 5 a.m. and lined up to be read off.
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; we called out, hardly more&rsquo;n awake. &ldquo;All present or accounted
for,&rdquo; said the sergeant to the Lieutenant, &ldquo;All except those
on wood pile or water detail in Company F will fall out for company
drill immediately after morning mess.&rdquo; The sergeant paused and
looked down the line until he spotted me. &ldquo;Special order,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;Private O&rsquo;Connor, Timothy, will report to the orderly
room to serve as chief clerk. O&rsquo;Connor!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yo,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;O&rsquo;Connor,
you&rsquo;re now a corporal. Get those stripes sewed on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>September 14, 1860. Discovered why I was made clerk. Seems
I&rsquo;m one of the few in my company who can write so&rsquo;s anybody can
read what&rsquo;s been writ. That schooling back in Indiana might have
been some good after all. Thing about being clerk is that I get to
know most of what&rsquo;s going to happen afore it happens. Company H
clerk told me yesterday that he put himself in for a promotion last
week.</p>
<p>The post is getting to seem like home to most of us by now.
Pretty fair place. The buildings are made of mud, or what people
around here call adobe. The adobes are made of brown clay and
baked in the sun, then stuck together with the same mud after they&rsquo;re
baked hard. The two barracks face the parade ground from the east
and from the west. They are both about 119 feet long and 33 feet
wide; the roofs are nearly flat, with a slight slope toward the parade.
The inside of each barrack is divided into several rooms, including:
company office, store room, two squad-rooms and a kitchen. The latter
is used also for mess. The walls are the same adobe, white-washed.
Each barrack was built to house one company. The squad rooms are
heated by open fireplaces&mdash;looks like we&rsquo;ll freeze come winter, except
when we&rsquo;re backed up to the fire burning our pants.</p>
<p>The officer&rsquo;s quarters are also of adobe, as is everything around
these parts, and are built along the north end of the parade. There
are quarters for seven officers and their families, but a man&rsquo;d have to
be pretty brave to bring his family out here. The officer&rsquo;s rooms are
ceiled with boards and plastered with mud, then whitewashed. Even
have board floor in these quarters, with bear skin and Indian blankets
scattered here and there. Some of the quarters have furniture brought
from the East, but most of the things are like the benches and tables
and bunks we soldiers have&mdash;made right here at the fort of cottonwood
or pine.</p>
<p>On the south end of the parade are two long buildings used for
offices and store rooms. The guard house is in one of these two, but
I don&rsquo;t care to learn of the interior of that place. I&rsquo;m told that it&rsquo;s
poorly ventilated, having no windows. In winter there&rsquo;s no heat in
the cells. The guards have a fireplace in their area, but the men in
the cells have to wear their blankets like Indians from morning &rsquo;til
night to keep warm. At night there&rsquo;s no sleeping, it&rsquo;s that cold.
Not many men getting in trouble during the cold months, I&rsquo;m told.</p>

<p>The stables are located some 120 paces due east of the
east barrack and are strong smelling quarters, consisting
of three long corrals built of the same old adobe. The corrals
contain sheds for the common horses and enclosed
stables for the officers&rsquo; mounts.</p>
<p>The post gets its water from the Ute Creek and water
from this stream flows in a ditch completely around the
parade. The water is cold and fresh the entire year, maybe
because it comes from the snows of Mount Blanca to the
north.</p>
<p>The post has a garden of about six acres, in which all
of us must take a tour of duty. In this plot the men try to
grow about everything, but only those vegetables or grains
which will ripen or mature in our short season are successful.</p>
<p>I discovered only today that this fort is on a reservation
covering about six square miles, with the post buildings
smack in the center. Back in Indiana that would be a considerable
piece of land, but out here that&rsquo;s no more&rsquo;n enough
to feed one good-sized jack rabbit.</p>
<p>December 26, 1860. Christmas come and gone for another
year. I&rsquo;ve never seen such a feast as we had here yesterday.
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
The weather was tough outside, with wind
and snow, but inside there was nothing but cheer. The
dinner consisted of every kind of meat that can be
had in this part of the Territory. We had smoked bear,
roast deer, elk and antelope; we had trout, wild duck,
and every breed of bird that walks or flys within fifty
miles of this place. One of the favorite pastimes of men
at our post is hunting&mdash;everything from bear to wild
cats and coyotes. Our Indian friends tell us we&rsquo;re driving
off the game, but that seems unlikely, at least not
for the next hundred years. Christmas was not all
eating; those who didn&rsquo;t get sick from eating too much
got into even worse shape from too much whiskey.
We all figured we might as well celebrate, seeing that
we&rsquo;re soon to have a new president, Abe Lincoln.
Some say that the South is so opposed to Abe and the
North in general that they&rsquo;ll pack up and leave the
Union. Some say they won&rsquo;t. I figure we got enough
troubles out here just trying to keep these Indians
from running loose.</p>
<p>May 3, 1861. Whole series of Indian uprisings
in Territory. A number of chiefs, including Chief
Uray<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
of the Tabequache Utes, stopped off here to
pow wow with our commander. Indians not happy
with rations issued by Indian Agent at Conejos. A
band of them left here and marched toward Denver
City.</p>
<p>June 1, 1861. Word just reached Garland that
Lincoln has called for 75,000 volunteers to serve three
months until trouble with the South can be settled.
Southerners here say it won&rsquo;t be over that soon, unless
the South wins. Some of the boys from the Southern
States have deserted&mdash;struck out for Texas.</p>

<p>August 4, 1861. Back East it seems the North
and South had a big battle at a place called &ldquo;Bull
Run.&rdquo; Most of the two outfits here at Garland are
preparing to leave for New Mexico, some say Fort
Craig. We&rsquo;ve been getting squad and company drill
every day since the war started. Last month we had
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
two sham battles. Seems us Indian fighters have got to learn all over again
how to fight Rebs. All the non-coms and the officers have been staying
up nights studying <i>Hardee&rsquo;s Tactics</i> and the book of <i>Army Regulations</i>.
Somehow or other I got promoted to sergeant.</p>

<p>October 20, 1861. Most of F and H Companies have left for Fort
Craig to join Major Canby. Re-enforcements, in the form of volunteers,
are expected soon. The old soldiers left here don&rsquo;t think much of the idea
of fighting with a bunch of recruits, but Governor Gilpin is looking under
every stone for troops. Most of Colorado&rsquo;s too busy looking for gold to
worry about the war.</p>

<p>December 29, 1861. Captain (T. R.) Dodd and Captain (J. H.) Ford
arrived with troops this month. Dodd&rsquo;s company left Canon City on December
7th and marched to Fort Garland by way of the Sangre de Cristo
Pass. His company was provisionally designated Company A of the Second
Colorado Infantry. Ford&rsquo;s group came struggling into camp on December
21st, having also marched from Canon City. This latter unit was provisionally
designated Company B of the Second Colorado Infantry. Captain
Dodd and his &ldquo;foot Volunteers&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t stay long, moving on to Santa Fe,
eventually bound for Fort Craig. Rumor has come north that a Major
(H. H.) Sibley, late of the United States Army, has come out to New Mexico
to win that territory for the South. He&rsquo;s got quite a crew assembled at
Fort Bliss; the last report listed &ldquo;Sibley&rsquo;s Brigade&rdquo; at over 3000 strong.
There&rsquo;s not that many fighting men in the whole Colorado Territory!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The volunteers are roosting around this fort like chickens. And sad
birds they are too. There&rsquo;s not a complete uniform in the whole lot and
not a man knows his right foot from his left. But they don&rsquo;t complain&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s something for soldiers, citizen or old army. The other evening
Company A had their men on guard duty around the buildings and in
one cold and windy spot the guard had on an old grey overcoat. The
overcoat was the only one the company had and every night it was given
to the guard at this post. The company commander was making his rounds
as usual when he spotted the familiar coat. He turned to his orderly and
said, &ldquo;Sergeant Ford, is the same man in that same d&mdash;&mdash; coat always on
guard here?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, be jabers,&rdquo; said Pat Ford, &ldquo;but the same coat kivers
the whole company now.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>March 17, 1862. Word received here that Garland is to be destroyed
if it is menaced by the enemy. Fort Union is to be defended at all cost.
Another detachment moves out of here tomorrow. I have asked to go.
The big battle seems to be shaping up in the south. Canby has been made
a colonel.</p>

<p>La Glorieta Pass, New Mexico, March 27, 1862. Arrived here about
time shooting was over. The Rebs have been turned back, some 280 killed
in two battles here. Our side was luckier. The heroes of this battle are
many, but Major (J. M.) Chivington and the Colorado Volunteers deserve
a big chunk of the credit. I guess we start the long march back, now
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>

<p>Fort Garland, October 5, 1862. Was sent with a
small detachment back to Garland. Fort about the same.
Commander now is Colonel Sam Tappan. Pretty good
man. More people coming into the San Luis Valley
every day. Either they&rsquo;re looking for gold or they&rsquo;re getting
away from the war&mdash;maybe both.</p>
<p>September 2, 1863. Been some nasty killings going
on around here and not by Indians either. Two brothers,
Felie Nerio and Vivian Espinosa, from San Rafael, a
little town at the edge of the mountains, have sworn to
kill every American they meet. Been doing a pretty good
job too, so far. Seems they even tried to kill Governor
(John) Evans when he was down this way. Didn&rsquo;t kill
the Governor but killed two others. The Governor had
offered a reward for these two and they didn&rsquo;t like the
thought of having their heads turned in for gold, I guess.
Like to collect that reward myself. Reports are that the
Espinosas have killed near thirty people in the valley
during the past few months.</p>
<p>September 11, 1863. Tom Tobin did it. I guess
Tobin had heard enough about the Espinosas, so when
Colonel Tappan asked him if he&rsquo;d head a party to go
find the murderers and bring them in, he accepted. Tobin
and Lieutenant Baldwin and fifteen soldiers from the
fort set out on September 7th. Tobin trailed Espinosa
like he&rsquo;d trail a deer or an Indian and after several days
found him along La Veta Creek. Espinosa was with his
cousin and fellow maniac in thick brush when Tobin
came on them. Tobin fired and wounded one, while
three soldiers fired at once and brought down the other.
Tobin then beheaded the two and took the heads to
Colonel Tappan. He rolled the heads from the sack and
said, &ldquo;Here Colonel, I have accomplished what you
wished. This head is Espinosa&rsquo;s. This other is his companion&rsquo;s
head and there&rsquo;s no mistake made.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
Since the other Espinosa brother was killed some weeks ago, I
guess that ends that little fracas. Tobin didn&rsquo;t even know
about the reward, he says. Some of the local citizens are
thinking of giving Tom a Hawkins rifle, like he&rsquo;s wanted
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
for a long time now, in appreciation for what
he&rsquo;s done.</p>

<p>May 4, 1864. Transferred last month to the
1st Colorado Cavalry, which means I&rsquo;ll be hitting
the dust trail for summer encampment in
a few days. Well, it&rsquo;ll beat pushing a pen around
in that stuffy orderly room or being stable nurse
to a bunch of horses.</p>
<p>May 6, 1864. Bunch of the boys went over
to Posthoff&rsquo;s last evening for a last blow before
leaving the post for the summer. The sutler&rsquo;s
store may have about all a soldier needs in the
way of underwear, boots, saddle soap, and the
rest, but it stocks no whiskey. Posthoff&rsquo;s store, being
off the reservation proper, takes care of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
shortage for us. Posthoff stocks about everything needed in these parts
by the civilians too, of course. But last night we tried to drink old Posthoff
out of liquor&mdash;and almost did. About every man in the 1st Cavalry
was there, with pretty Mexican and Indian girls bringing in food and
filling our cups. All day long a company of horse soldiers have been
sorry they kept such late hours. The smell of dust and saddle leather has
done a lot for our thirst, but little for our appetites. It&rsquo;s days like this
that make me wonder if the $17 a sergeant gets each month is worth it.</p>

Park. Camp life isn&rsquo;t bad; just as many bugles blown during the
day as at the fort and just as much work, but a tent&rsquo;s easier to keep clean

<p>Fort Garland, November 21, 1864. Back at the fort life goes on
about as before. Nights are getting cold. We sit inside evenings now
next to fires of pi&ntilde;on logs. Some spend the hours playing cards, others
read or study, and some form small groups and sing. The inside of the
quarters look good after months in the open. The white walls and blue
furniture and woodwork have come to mean home to me. The wooden
beds, designed to sleep two, may be covered only with a straw tick, but
it&rsquo;s a lot softer than the ground. The food is better at the fort than in
the field, of course. The hardtack and provisions carried on march leave
something to be desired. The hardtack we&rsquo;re getting must have been
made by the Rebs. Even the hot coffee won&rsquo;t soften it. Corporal
White said the other night that once he found something soft inside
a hardtack biscuit and when he looked to see what it was, he found
that it was an old rifle ball. &ldquo;Looked like the kind used during the
War of 1812,&rdquo; cracked White.</p>

<p>December 5, 1864. Just heard the news of Colonel Chivington
wiping out a whole tribe of Indians at Sand Creek. If word gets back
to any friends of those poor devils I&rsquo;m thinking we&rsquo;d better all start
cleaning our carbines and looking for a hole to crawl into.</p>
<p>News from the East is that Lincoln has been re-elected. War
seems about won by the Union forces. Things been going bad for Lee
since Gettysburg.</p>
<p>May 4, 1865. Lee gives up at a place called Appomattox. Even
the Texans have decided to quit. The boys here are looking to be sent
home, since most are volunteers. Only a handfull of regulars like myself
have been at the fort during these war years. Might take a leave
myself or just give up being a soldier.</p>
<p>April 2, 1866. Back from leave. Brought a wife with me. Never
thought of getting married, but while in Denver last winter I met
Molly and first thing I knew she had me. We moved into the married
quarters for non-coms over northeast of the general inclosure. Molly
don&rsquo;t seem to mind life at the fort, in spite of the fact that she, like
all the other non-com wives, has to spend considerable time every week
washing shirts and socks in the post laundry.</p>
<p>Being married throws a new light on life in the fort. People get
together for parties and talk. The wives are more ambitious for the
men than the men are for themselves. &ldquo;When are <i>you</i> going to be promoted?&rdquo;
they all ask their husbands. What&rsquo;s the difference if you&rsquo;re
making $13 as a private or $17 as a sergeant?</p>

<p>May 7, 1866. Colonel (and Brevet Brigadier General) Kit Carson
is our new commander. He commanded a regiment of New Mexico
Volunteers during the war and was sent on here with
some of his old men. Good thing they sent a man like
Colonel Carson to old Garland&mdash;those cantankerous
Utes have been raising cane around the settlements for
several months and seem to be getting worse. About
the only reason they haven&rsquo;t declared war on all of us
is that one of their chiefs, called Uray or
Ulay,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
has been keeping them in harness.</p>
<p>June 28, 1866. Started building hospital northeast
of parade. Adobes not baked properly&mdash;rain all the
time. Building won&rsquo;t stand for many seasons.</p>
<p>July 18, 1866. Our commander is a man to be respected.
He&rsquo;s keeping this Indian Pot from boiling in
these parts by his will alone. The Utes are short on
rations, some of them starving. They come to the fort
and beg food almost every day. Maybe they&rsquo;re not as
hungry as they act, but they are hungry enough to be
dangerous. Colonel Carson sends them away with what
he can spare and has written to the Indian Agent for rations
for the nearby tribes. The guard in the crow&rsquo;s nest
on the flag pole keeps a wary eye on the valley these
nights. This fort has never been attacked, but the settlements
about have been molested on several occasions.</p>
<p>September 12, 1866. Molly let me know that I&rsquo;m to
be a father come next spring. An old blue coat like myself
a father! Good news comes in bunches; I was made
Sergeant Major today, with a salary increase to $23. That
should keep a family of five!</p>

<p>Sat watching Kit Carson, our commander, this evening.
He stood alone on the parade grounds after retreat; the
last soft sound of the bugle had died away and the troops
had been dismissed. Carson stood looking up at that towering
flag staff for about five minutes before he turned
away. He looked uncomfortable in his uniform, as he
always does. A more unmilitary man I&rsquo;ve never known&mdash;and
yet a better commander none of us would ever
want. He makes up for his lack of book-learning with his
knowledge of everything there is to know of hunting,
trapping, Indian fighting and woods lore. He&rsquo;s a short
man, about five feet four, with legs so bowed he looks
astride a horse even when he&rsquo;s walking. Here at Garland,
Colonel Carson has kept open house&mdash;open to all passersby
(Indian and White) and even to soldiers and their
wives. The wild tribe of children he brought with him
are as untamed as the beasts of the mountains. One thing
about it, though, when a dispute arises between Indians
and settlers, the first to be called in is our &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; as
the Utes call him. I&rsquo;ve seen him sitting in the middle of
them, laughing and joking in Spanish or Ute tongue,
making hand movements for each word he speaks. Maybe
it helps him to be understood.</p>
<p>September 23, 1866. We&rsquo;ve had big doings round
here. Lieutenant General W. T. Sherman, Governor
(A.) Cumming, a whole patch of Ute chiefs and Kit
Carson met to try to work out a treaty. This was to
be a preliminary council afore the big one to be held
on the banks of the Rio Grande, some thirty miles from
here. On one side of the council room squatted the chiefs
and on the other side sat Sherman, smoking a long cigar,
with Kit on one side of him and the Governor on the
other. Carson talked to the chiefs, he being the only one
who could speak any language they could all understand.
Kit urged the Utes to take to a reservation, as Sherman
wanted them to do, but they didn&rsquo;t like the idea. Chief
Uray told Kit he knew he spoke for the Indian&rsquo;s good,
but that they couldn&rsquo;t live so confined. Sherman gave up,
finally, remarking that they&rsquo;d have to freeze and starve
a little bit more afore they&rsquo;d listen to reason. The next
council meeting gained only a little more. Governor
Cumming did get the Tabequaches to agree to a treaty
which permitted roads to be built through their lands.
Chief Uray had signed another treaty in 1864. Uray
even took a trip to Washington by stage and train and
talked with President Lincoln. They say he came back
and told his people that the Indians could never keep
the white men out of their lands; that there were too
many of them. Mighty smart Indian.</p>

<p>October 10, 1866. Some of the Ute tribes have
been on the warpath again. Chief
Cuneatch<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
is angry with Uray for dealing with the Whites and has stirred
up some of the other chiefs. A few settlers and some
Indians have been killed. The post stands as a strong
point in the Valley these days, but our commander,
Colonel Carson, and his friend Chief Uray are our
real strength. Carson has told all the Indians to camp
near the fort and not go north for their presents
this year. He has promised them food and presents if
they stay and remain peaceful. Some of the young
bucks will go to war, but Carson and Uray will keep
the remainder of the Utes hobbled and staked.</p>
<p>October 28, 1866. Captain (A. J.) Alexander of
the 3rd Cavalry and some of his men took care of
Cuneatch&rsquo;s band of trouble-makers. They rounded up
most of them and brought them into the fort; had to
kill a few of them, however, before they could get
old Cuneatch to come. Colonel Carson wants to get
some kind of agreement or treaty signed with this
bunch of Utes before real trouble sets in.</p>
<p>April 25, 1868. Kit Carson is dead. He died on
the 23rd, after his return from Washington. He and
several Ute chiefs, including Chief Uray, went to
Washington to confer on a treaty for the Ute or
Utah Indians. The treaty was drawn-up, but hasn&rsquo;t
been ratified by Congress. But old Kit is dead! His
last official act was to try to keep the peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>July 17, 1868. My outfit is leaving Garland and this time
I&rsquo;ll be going along. I wonder when or if I&rsquo;ll see the fort again?
Meyer and Posthoff entertained the whole detachment last
night with a farewell blow. Molly and our two little ones will
have to follow me to the new post at a later date.</p>
<p>(The Valley was fairly peaceful during the years of Sgt.
O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s absence. Life at the fort changed but little, as new
companies of Infantry and Cavalry came and went.)</p>
<p>September 10, 1879. Back home again. Returned to Fort
Garland last week after more&rsquo;n ten years here, there and everywhere,
with first one outfit and then another. A soldier&rsquo;s life
is a weary one. But it&rsquo;s good to be back here where I really
began soldiering. Let&rsquo;s see now, been 19 years since I first
came to Garland. The place has changed since the early days.
Even got a railroad running by the fort&mdash;came in &rsquo;78. Two
years earlier Colorado Territory was made the 38th State. New
buildings have been added; all made of the same old adobe,
of course. The parade is a little greener and the cottonwood
trees have grown tall enough to make good shade. The barrack
rooms are now heated with stoves as well as fireplaces
and they&rsquo;ve built a kitchen and mess to the southwest
of the Infantry barrack. The soldiers&rsquo; quarters
have a little more furniture and the officers&rsquo;
quarters are a little more spick and span. More
females about the place, too, now that the Valley
is more civilized. The soldiers here are a lot
younger than they used to be; lot of pink-faced
boys who&rsquo;ve never heard an Indian whoop.</p>

<p>October 10, 1879. We just got news of
the Indian uprising in Western Colorado. An
Indian agent by the name of N. C. Meeker at
the White River Agency was killed and some
of his people killed or carried off. Major T. T.
Thornburgh and his troops from Fort Steele, Wyoming, had
been sent for before the affair began, but they didn&rsquo;t arrive in
time to save Meeker. Battle began on September 29th and took
place somewhere between Beaver Creek and Milk River between
Thornburgh&rsquo;s men and a whole parcel of Utes under a
chief named Jack. It&rsquo;s said that Thornburgh had less than 150
men, mostly Cavalry, while the Utes numbered 300-400. A detachment
of colored troops from Garland in on the affair, we&rsquo;re
told. Thornburgh made a defense and held off the Utes for several
days, but the situation was pretty bad. By the 1st of October
they got word to Rawlings, Wyoming and a General Merritt set
out with about 350 men. On the morning of the 5th, after a
170 mile forced march, Merritt&rsquo;s men arrived at the burned-over
circle of wagons which marked the defender&rsquo;s position. I
know how Thornburgh&rsquo;s men yelled when they saw that relief
column that morning. I&rsquo;ve set-up considerable howl myself
on similar occasions. In cases like that you don&rsquo;t care if the
men coming to rescue you are Infantry or Cavalry, you&rsquo;re
that glad.</p>
<p>June 4, 1880. More troops coming into the fort every
day. The fracas out at the White River Agency last year has
caused considerable excitement, although the Indians around
here have been fairly quiet. Chief Uray has done a lot to keep
things peaceful in the valley. If he&rsquo;d had his way about it,
the Thornburgh affair wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. The post and
the town are bustling&mdash;they even got a hotel here now. It
may not be much for comfort, but it&rsquo;s something for these parts.
If they don&rsquo;t stop sending in new units and new men, some
of us may be sleeping in worse places than the hotel.</p>
<p>September 1, 1880. Bad news came this week. Chief
Uray or Ouray, as some call him, died on August 24. He&rsquo;d
been made big chief of the Utes and had held them pretty
well in tow; hard to say what will happen now. More men
coming into Garland. Most of the new-comers are living in tents.</p>

<p>June 1, 1881. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) R. S. Mackenzie,
in command of the troops stationed here at the fort, has set out
for the Uncompahgre valley to prepare to move the Utes into Utah.
Old Ouray is dead and the thing he never wanted to see is going to
happen&mdash;his people will be moved to a reservation. Maybe it&rsquo;s best
for them.</p>
<p>October 1, 1881. The Utes had to be threatened by Mackenzie
before they&rsquo;d start the long hike into Utah, but when they found they
had no choice they went quietly and mighty pronto. The Whites thereabout
were, of course, happy to see them leave. Everyone realizes that
this puts an end to any Indian menace in the State.</p>
<p>March 16, 1882. With the Indians gone, the old fort is back to
normal and maybe short of normal. Last year we had as many as 1500
men here&mdash;now we&rsquo;re down to a couple of companies. My boys are
growing up, but by the time they&rsquo;re soldier age it appears there won&rsquo;t
be any place for them to soldier.</p>
<p>July 4, 1882. Had a big Independence Day celebration here today.
Not much else to celebrate. Inspection team came to the fort again this
week and it looks as if they&rsquo;re going to close up all the old forts and
kick-out all the old soldiers. The company commander, a young buck,
had the brass to tell me I was getting too old to soldier. This fort&rsquo;s
getting old too. They haven&rsquo;t been keeping the adobe walls plastered
with mud like they used to and the rains have been making little rivers
down the sides of the buildings.</p>
<p>February 5, 1883. At the end of this enlistment&mdash;which comes up
in December this year&mdash;they say I&rsquo;ve got to retire. I&rsquo;m not an old man,
but several old wounds have been bothering me and the doctor turned
in a bad report on me. Why! I won&rsquo;t know what to do away from
the Army and this old fort. They might as well shoot me like they
do a horse that&rsquo;s broken his leg.</p>
<p>October 10, 1883. Major General John Pope, commanding the
Department of the Missouri, has recommended to the War Department
that they close several Indian forts and Garland is one of them. Well,
the old fort and the old soldier can go together.</p>
<p>November 29, 1883. Tomorrow the fort closes&mdash;likely forever.
Company A, 22nd United States Infantry, under the command of
Captain Javan Irvine, will leave here for Fort Lewis, Colorado, and no
new company will come to replace it&mdash;as has happened for these past
twenty-odd years. Somehow it won&rsquo;t seem so bad to leave the Army
now, knowing that Garland and I close our gates together. Family and
I are going to stay on in the valley and try doing a little ranching. Got
a whole flock of kids to help.</p>

<h2 id="c2">Fort Garland Becomes A State Museum</h2>

<p>In 1883 Fort Garland was abandoned and the
equipment belonging to the fort was sent to the
new Fort Lewis, while the fort lands reverted to
the Trinchera Estate. For many years stock wandered
across the parade to nibble of the grass once
trod by drilling soldiers&mdash;rats and other small animals
inhabited the barracks and officer&rsquo;s quarters.
Decay and erosion set to work in earnest in an effort
to destroy the old fort. It appeared that the
once proud adobe walls would become a part of
the soil again and that Fort Garland would be only
a memory in the minds of a few old soldiers who
had made the garrison their home.</p>
<p>In 1915 W. H. Meyer, a State senator, bought
the property and used the commandant&rsquo;s house for
his home. One of the barracks became a barn. The
Meyer home was altered soon afterwards, a gable
roof and additional windows being added. Fortunately,
Meyer was interested in history and in
the fort. He tried to keep the remaining buildings
in some kind of repair and never deliberately
changed the appearance of any building to any extent
other than the commandant&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<p>Senator Meyer died in 1925 and a group of interested
citizens of the San Luis Valley formed the
Fort Garland Historical Fair Association and purchased
the fort, with the idea of preserving what
remained and someday establishing a museum. Over
600 persons in the surrounding area supported this
project. A small museum was begun in the commandant&rsquo;s
house and once again the fort heard the
sound of many voices, and felt the tread of many
feet.</p>
<p>After several years of vain effort to maintain
the fort buildings, the Fort Garland Historical Fair
Association decided the job was one that should be
done by a larger institution. In 1945 the fort and
its land were deeded to the State Historical Society
of Colorado, for restoration and development as a State historical monument.
For two years Curator Edgar C. McMechen and his staff at the
Denver museum worked and planned for the restoration of the five remaining
buildings at the fort. In 1947 the actual restoration was begun.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Mr. McMechen, a meticulous scholar, sought to reconstruct the
fort as nearly as possible to its original appearance. He wished to use
every original stone, every brick, every timber that was sound in the
reconstructed buildings. The first step in the restoration was the removal
of the old roofs which had, for the most part, collapsed or become
unsound. The five buildings under construction were the west
barracks, sometimes referred to as the Infantry barracks, the east, or
Cavalry barracks, and three of the original five officer&rsquo;s quarters along
the north of the parade. The east barracks had suffered the most from
lack of repair and deterioration. One wall had crumbled and fallen
away and nothing remained of the roof but the cross beams. The buildings
to the south had long since disappeared and while the Society
planned to rebuild these two long structures, it found it impossible to
undertake the task at that time. The two officers&rsquo; quarters located immediately
to the right and left of the commandant&rsquo;s building had also
vanished and were not to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>The reconstruction work on the fort buildings required careful
supervision. The adobe bricks were made as they were made in 1858&mdash;the
mud being molded in forms and placed in the sun to bake. After
the adobes were set in place, the walls were plastered inside and out
with a coat of the same adobe material. Mexican women were employed
to work the mud into the crevices and give the walls a smooth surface.
This they did with their hands, alone, just as it has been done in the
Southwest United States for centuries.</p>
<p>Plans for the fort museum called for the following: the commanding
officers&rsquo; quarters, where Colonel Kit Carson commanded in 1866-67,
to be restored as nearly as possible as it was when the famous scout resided
there, with deer and antelope heads on the walls and the skins
of animals covering the floor; one of the officer&rsquo;s quarters to be used for
a resident curator and not to be open to the public; the Cavalry barracks
to be utilized as a period museum, to represent the history of the San
Luis Valley from the days of the Spanish Conquest to pioneer settlement;
the Infantry barracks to contain a typical squad room and the old soldier&rsquo;s
theatre. The painted backdrop on the wall of the theatre was
still visible prior to restoration and the simple mural was to be restored.
At some later date the two buildings to the south of the parade, on
either side of the port sally, were to be rebuilt and would include the
commandant&rsquo;s and adjutant&rsquo;s offices, the guard room, prisoners&rsquo; cells,
post blacksmith shop, the post bakery and the post chapel. These rooms
would all be furnished and equipped in the manner of the fort&rsquo;s original
service buildings.</p>

<p>The Fort Garland Museum is an attempt to preserve in all its many
aspects, military life at a frontier post in the 1860&rsquo;s-70&rsquo;s. The museum
is also a store-house for the history of the southern portion of the State
of Colorado. Many methods have been utilized to depict and present
the colorful and exciting history of this area. In the west barrack, several
dioramas illustrate in miniature scenes of: the Spanish Conquest,
a Ute Indian camp, fur trading, a Mexican village, an Army escort
wagon, a mule pack train and ambulance, and a stage coach robbery.
Glass cases house a large collection of both military and pioneer materials.
Period rooms, using life size manikins dressed in authentic costumes,
will be placed in appropriate room settings, i.e., Kit Carson in
conference with his aides and Chief Ouray.</p>
<p>In September of 1950 the reconstructed Fort Garland was dedicated
with an impressive ceremony. Dr. James Grafton Rogers, president
of the Society, gave the dedicatory address. Hundreds of persons
from the surrounding area were on hand to see a long time dream
of the region come to fruition.</p>
<p>The State of Colorado is indebted to a great number of people
in the San Luis Valley, in particular, for their aid in bringing Fort
Garland into being as a State monument, but the list would be too long
to enter here. The State Historical Society is especially appreciative of
the aid given and interest show by members of the Fort Garland Historical
Fair Association, the Territorial Daughters and the Regional
Committee on Fort Garland.</p>
<p class="bq">Mrs. Rosamund Slack assumed curatorship of Fort Garland
in 1950, after the death of her husband, James Slack,
who had been the curator.</p>
